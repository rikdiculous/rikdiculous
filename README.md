## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Rik**. I am a student working toward a Master of Science in Management. 

I joined GitHub to better learn econometrics and data analysis using R.

Academic areas of interest include innovation and talent clusters, agglomeration economies, knowledge spillovers, human capital theory, and leadership, management, and teamwork.
